BIT 2305 Human Computer Interface

Continuous Assessment for the Class Small Groups
In order to appreciate the input-output channels of a user, each small group should carry out the following exercise:
Develop an Android mobile phone app called IHearYou that recognizes when the user audibly makes any of these statements: “Blue” and “Red”. It appropriately responds to the user: audibly by telling the user “Here is the blue screen” or “Here is the red screen”, and visually by displaying a blue screen or by displaying a red screen (respectively).

Deadline
Friday, 7th March 2025 (for now the small groups should ensure that they complete the exercise, details on demonstration/presentation will be communicated later)
